no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no nothing in
his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because I didnt call him
Hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from a cabbage thats what you get
for not keeping them in their proper place pulling off his shoes and trousers
there on the chair before me so barefaced without even asking permission and
standing out that vulgar way in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired
like a priest or a butcher or those old hypocrites in the time of Julius
Caesar of course hes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure
you might as well be in bed with what with a lion God Im sure hed have
something better to say for himself an old Lion would O well I suppose its
because they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he couldnt
resist they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the amount of
pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and white for them always I
wished I was one myself for a change just to try with that thing they have
swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so soft when you touch it my
uncle John has a thing long I heard those cornerboys saying passing the comer
of Marrowbone lane my aunt Mary has a thing hairy because it was dark and they
knew a girl was passing it didnt make me blush why should it either its only
nature and he puts his thing long into my aunt Marys hairy etcetera and turns
out to be you put the handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can
pick and choose what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl for
their different tastes like those houses round behind Irish street no but were
to be always chained up theyre not going to be chaining me up no damn fear
once I start I tell you for their stupid husbands jealousy why cant we all
remain friends over it instead of quarrelling her husband found it out what
they did together well naturally and if he did can he undo it hes coronado
anyway whatever he does and then he going to the other mad extreme about the
wife in Fair Tyrants of course the man never even casts a 2nd thought on the
husband or wife either its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were
we given all those desires for Id like to know I cant help it if Im young
still can I its a wonder Im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living
with him so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the wrong
end of me not knowing I suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a womans bottom
Id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything unnatural where we havent
I atom of any kind of expression in us all of us the same 2 lumps of lard
before ever Id do that to a man pfooh the dirty brutes the mere thought is
enough I kiss the feet of you senorita theres some sense in that didnt he kiss
our halldoor yes he did what a madman nobody understands his cracked ideas but
me still of course a woman wants to be embraced 20 times a day almost to make
her look young no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody
if the fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the Lord God I was thinking
would I go around by the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd know me
and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not care a pin
whose I was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of those wildlooking
gipsies in Rathfarnham had their camp pitched near the Bloomfield laundry to
try and steal our things if they could I only sent mine there a few times for
the name model laundry sending me back over and over some old ones odd
stockings that blackguardlooking fellow with the fine eyes peeling a switch
attack me in the dark and ride me up against the wall without a word or a
murderer anybody what they do themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats
that K C lives up somewhere this way coming out of Hardwicke lane the night he
gave us the fish supper on account of winning over the boxing match of course
it was for me he gave it I knew him by his gaiters and the walk and when I
turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after coming out of
it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his wife after that only I
suppose the half of those sailors are rotten again with disease O move over
your big carcass out of that for the love of Mike listen to him the winds that
waft my sighs to thee so well he may sleep and sigh the great Suggester Don
Poldo de la Flora if he knew how he came out on the cards this morning hed
have something to sigh for a dark man in some perplexity between 2 7s too in
prison for Lord knows what he does that I dont know and Im to be slooching
around down in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled
up like a mummy will I indeed did you ever see me running Id just like to see
myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt I dont care what
anybody says itd be much better for the world to be governed by the women in
it you wouldnt see women going and killing one another and slaughtering when
do you ever see women rolling around drunk like they do or gambling every
penny they have and losing it on horses yes because a woman whatever she does
she knows where to stop sure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us
they dont know what it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where
would they all of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what I
never had thats why I suppose hes running wild now out at night away from his
books and studies and not living at home on account of the usual rowy house I
suppose well its a poor case that those that have a fine son like that theyre
not satisfied and I none was he not able to make one it wasnt my fault we came
together when I was watching the two dogs up in her behind in the middle of
the naked street that disheartened me altogether I suppose I oughtnt to have
buried him in that little woolly jacket I knitted crying as I was but give it
to some poor child but I knew well Id never have another our 1st death too it
was we were never the same since O Im not going to think myself into the
glooms about that any more I wonder why he wouldnt stay the night I felt all
the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of roving around the
city meeting God knows who nightwalkers and pickpockets his poor mother
wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining himself for life perhaps still its
a lovely hour so silent I used to love coming home after dances the air of the
night they have friends they can talk to weve none either he wants what he
wont get or its some woman ready to stick her knife in you I hate that in
women no wonder they treat us the way they do we are a dreadful lot of bitches
I suppose its all the troubles we have makes us so snappy Im not like that he
could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room I suppose he was
as shy as a boy he being so young hardly 20 of me in the next room hed have
heard me on the chamber arrah what harm Dedalus I wonder its like those names
in Gibraltar Delapaz Delagracia they had the devils queer names there father
Vilaplana of Santa Maria that gave me the rosary Rosales y OReilly in the
Calle las Siete Revueltas and Pisimbo and Mrs Opisso in Governor street O what
a name Id go and drown myself in the first river if I had a name like her O my
and all the bits of streets Paradise ramp and Bedlam ramp and Rodgers ramp and
Crutchetts ramp and the devils gap steps well small blame to me if I am a
harumscarum I know I am a bit I declare to God I dont feel a day older than
then I wonder could I get my tongue round any of the Spanish como esta usted
muy bien gracias y usted see I havent forgotten it all I thought I had only
for the grammar a noun is the name of any person place or thing pity I never
tried to read that novel cantankerous Mrs Rubio lent me by Valera with the
questions in it all upside down the two ways I always knew wed go away in the
end I can tell him the Spanish and he tell me the Italian then hell see Im not
so ignorant what a pity he didnt stay Im sure the poor fellow was dead tired
and wanted a good sleep badly I could have brought him in his breakfast in bed
with a bit of toast so long as I didnt do it on the knife for bad luck or if
the woman was going her rounds with the watercress and something nice and
tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might like I never could bear
the look of them in Abrines I could do the criada the room looks all right
since I changed it the other way you see something was telling me all the time
Id have to introduce myself not knowing me from Adam very funny wouldnt it Im
his wife or pretend we were in Spain with him half awake without a Gods notion
where he is dos huevos estrellados senor Lord the cracked things come into my
head sometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us why not theres the
room upstairs empty and Millys bed in the back room he could do his writing
and studies at the table in there for all the scribbling he does at it and if
he wants to read in bed in the morning like me as hes making the breakfast for
I he can make it for 2 Im sure Im not going to take in lodgers off the street
for him if he takes a gesabo of a house like this Id love to have a long talk
with an intelligent welleducated person Id have to get a nice pair of red
slippers like those Turks with the fez used to sell or yellow and a nice
semitransparent morning gown that I badly want or a peachblossom dressing
jacket like the one long ago in Walpoles only 8/6 or 18/6 Ill just give him
one more chance Ill get up early in the morning Im sick of Cohens old bed in
any case I might go over to the markets to see all the vegetables and cabbages
and tomatoes and carrots and all kinds of splendid fruits all coming in lovely
and fresh who knows whod be the 1st man Id meet theyre out looking for it in
the morning Mamy Dillon used to say they are and the night too that was her
massgoing Id love a big juicy pear now to melt in your mouth like when I used
to be in the longing way then Ill throw him up his eggs and tea in the
moustachecup she gave him to make his mouth bigger I suppose hed like my nice
cream too I know what Ill do Ill go about rather gay not too much singing a
bit now and then mi fa pieta Masetto then Ill start dressing myself to go out
presto non son piu forte Ill put on my best shift and drawers let him have a
good eyeful out of that to make his micky stand for him Ill let him know if
thats what he wanted that his wife is I s l o fucked yes and damn well fucked
too up to my neck nearly not by him 5 or 6 times handrunning theres the mark
of his spunk on the clean sheet I wouldnt bother to even iron it out that
ought to satisfy him if you dont believe me feel my belly unless I made him
stand there and put him into me Ive a mind to tell him every scrap and make
him do it out in front of me serve him right its all his own fault if I am an
adulteress as the thing in the gallery said O much about it if thats all the
harm ever we did in this vale of tears God knows its not much doesnt everybody
only they hide it I suppose thats what a woman is supposed to be there for or
He wouldnt have made us the way He did so attractive to men then if he wants
to kiss my bottom Ill drag open my drawers and bulge it right out in his face
as large as life he can stick his tongue 7 miles up my hole as hes there my
brown part then Ill tell him I want LI or perhaps 30/- Ill tell him I want to
buy underclothes then if he gives me that well he wont be too bad I dont want
to soak it all out of him like other women do I could often have written out a
fine cheque for myself and write his name on it for a couple of pounds a few
times he forgot to lock it up besides he wont spend it Ill let him do it off
on me behind provided he doesnt smear all my good drawers O I suppose that
cant be helped Ill do the indifferent l or 2 questions Ill know by the answers
when hes like that he cant keep a thing back I know every turn in him Ill
tighten my bottom well and let out a few smutty words smellrump or lick my
shit or the first mad thing comes into my head then Ill suggest about yes O
wait now sonny my turn is coming Ill be quite gay and friendly over it O but I
was forgetting this bloody pest of a thing pfooh you wouldnt know which to
laugh or cry were such a mixture of plum and apple no Ill have to wear the old
things so much the better itll be more pointed hell never know whether he did
it or not there thats good enough for you any old thing at all then Ill wipe
him off me just like a business his omission then Ill go out Ill have him
eying up at the ceiling where is she gone now make him want me thats the only
way a quarter after what an unearthly hour I suppose theyre just getting up in
China now combing out their pigtails for the day well soon have the nuns
ringing the angelus theyve nobody coming in to spoil their sleep except an odd
priest or two for his night office or the alarmclock next door at cockshout
clattering the brains out of itself let me see if I can doze off 1 2 3 4 5
what kind of flowers are those they invented like the stars the wallpaper in
Lombard street was much nicer the apron he gave me was like that something
only I only wore it twice better lower this lamp and try again so as I can get
up early Ill go to Lambes there beside Findlaters and get them to send us some
flowers to put about the place in case he brings him home tomorrow today I
mean no no Fridays an unlucky day first I want to do the place up someway the
dust grows in it I think while Im asleep then we can have music and cigarettes
I can accompany him first I must clean the keys of the piano with milk whatll
I wear shall I wear a white rose or those fairy cakes in Liptons I love the
smell of a rich big shop at 7 1/2d a lb or the other ones with the cherries in
them and the pinky sugar I Id a couple of lbs of those a nice plant for the
middle of the table Id get that cheaper in wait wheres this I saw them not
long ago I love flowers Id love to have the whole place swimming in roses God
of heaven theres nothing like nature the wild mountains then the sea and the
waves rushing then the beautiful country with the fields of oats and wheat and
all kinds of things and all the fine cattle going about that would do your
heart good to see rivers and lakes and flowers all sorts of shapes and smells
and colours springing up even out of the ditches primroses and violets nature
it is as for them saying theres no God I wouldnt give a snap of my two fingers
for all their learning why dont they go and create something I often asked him
atheists or whatever they call themselves go and wash the cobbles off
themselves first then they go howling for the priest and they dying and why
why because theyre afraid of hell on account of their bad conscience ah yes I
know them well who was the first person in the universe before there was
anybody that made it all who ah that they dont know neither do I so there you
are they might as well try to stop the sun from rising tomorrow the sun shines
for you he said the day we were lying among the rhododendrons on Howth head in
the grey tweed suit and his straw hat the day I got him to propose to me yes
first I gave him the bit of seedcake out of my mouth and it was leapyear like
now yes 16 years ago my God after that long kiss I near lost my breath yes he
said I was a flower of the mountain yes so we are flowers all a womans body
yes that was one true thing he said in his life and the sun shines for you
today yes that was why I liked him because I saw he understood or felt what a
woman is and I knew I could always get round him and I gave him all the
pleasure I could leading him on till he asked me to say yes and I wouldnt
answer first only looked out over the sea and the sky I was thinking of so
many things he didnt know of Mulvey and Mr Stanhope and Hester and father and
old captain Groves and the sailors playing all birds fly and I say stoop and
washing up dishes they called it on the pier and the sentry in front of the
governors house with the thing round his white helmet poor devil half roasted
and the Spanish girls laughing in their shawls and their tall combs and the
auctions in the morning the Greeks and the jews and the Arabs and the devil
knows who else from all the ends of Europe and Duke street and the fowl market
all clucking outside Larby Sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half asleep
and the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the steps and the
big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle thousands of years old
yes and those handsome Moors all in white and turbans like kings asking you to
sit down in their little bit of a shop and Ronda with the old windows of the
posadas 2 glancing eyes a lattice hid for her lover to kiss the iron and the
wineshops half open at night and the castanets and the night we missed the
boat at Algeciras the watchman going about serene with his lamp and O that
awful deepdown torrent O and the sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and
the glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the Alameda gardens yes and all the
queer little streets and the pink and blue and yellow houses and the
rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and Gibraltar as a
girl where I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I put the rose in my hair
like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he kissed me
under the Moorish wall and I thought well as well him as another and then I
asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes to
say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and drew him
down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going
like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes.
