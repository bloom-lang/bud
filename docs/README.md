#Bud: Bloom under development#
Welcome to the documentation for *Bud*, a prototype of Bloom under development.

The documents here are organized to be read in any order, but you might like to try the following:

* **intro.md**: A brief introduction to Bud and Bloom
* **getstarted.md**: A quickstart to teach you basic Bloom concepts, the use of `rebl` interactive terminal, and the embedding of Bloom code in Ruby via the `Bud` module.
* **operational.md**: an operational view of Bloom, to provide a more detailed  model of how Bloom code is evaluated by Bud.
* **cheat.md**: A concise "cheat sheet" to remind you about Bloom syntax.
* **modules.md**: An overview of Bloom's modularity features.
* **ruby_hooks.md**: Bud module methods that allow you to interact with the Bud evaluator from other Ruby threads.
* **visualizations.md**: Overview of the `budvis` and `budplot` tools for visualizing Bloom program analyses.
* **bfs.md**:  A walkthrough of the Bloom distributed filesystem.
* **bud-sandbox**: a github repository including lots of useful libraries and examples.
* **Bud RubyDoc**: The Bud gem ships with RubyDoc on the language constructs and runtime hooks provided by the Bud module.  (To see rdoc, you run `gem server` from a command line and open [http://0.0.0.0:8808/](http://0.0.0.0:8808/))
