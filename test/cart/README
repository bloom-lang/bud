The Bloom code related to the CIDR submission and demo is in the ./lib subdirection.

delivery.rb, reliable_delivery.rd and quorum_delivery.rb are modules providing
transport services with increasing guarantees.  Any module that communicates
may subclass these modules or one of their descendents.

kvs.rb is a very simple replicated key-value store.  It extends one of the delivery
modules.  By inserting in the kvput() relation, code using kvs.rb (subclasses or
instantiators) can store opaque values associated with keys, replacing the value
associated with the key if one already exists.  

Note that if multiple rows are inserted into kvput() with the same key value,
the key-value store will throw a key conflict exception.  To avoid this behavior,
a user that wishes to perform a series of puts may need to 'meter' the input, 
using a queue.  queue.rb provides this functionality.  

imperative_cart.rb is the complete code for the 'destructive' code presented in the
CIDR submission.  It extends kvs.rb.

Finally, lazy_cart.rb is the complete code the 'disorderly' cart.  As described in the
paper, this shopping cart does not have a layered design like the destructive cart:
instead it 'rolls its own' replication and storage.
